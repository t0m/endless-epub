h1. Endless Epub

This is a simple desktop epub reader that loads everything into one page rather than making you click "next page" constantly. I've found it very useful for reference books where you need to look at the previous page frequently for example code, etc.

h2. To run locally

Firefox:
Download the project zip from github, open index.html, and select an epub

Chrome (windows):
Download the project zip from github, run the mongoose.exe server, visit http://localhost:8080 on your browser, and select an epub.

IE:
IE9 definitely doesn't work, IE10 PP might.

Here's some epubs to give it a try with:
